### Beer Wish List

My project is a beer wish list pulling from https://api.brewerydb.com to grab
beers and breweries to add to your wishlist of beers and breweries you want to try. You can
add, delete, and edit beers/breweries on your wishlist. The user would be able to login and see
all this wishlist.
