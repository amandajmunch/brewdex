### Beer Wish List

My project is a beer wish list pulling from https://api.brewerydb.com to grab
beers and breweries to add to your wishlist of beers and breweries you want to try. You can
add, delete, and edit beers/breweries on your wishlist. The user would be able to login and see
all this wishlist.

### Approach Taken

I began by wireframing my project visually and modeling my code from previous projects.
I then made sure I could pull data from the API and add that to the database. Then, with 
each step completed, I added login functionality.

### Installation Instructions

If the user does not have a login and password, they will be prompted to create an account. 
Then, they will take their account information and login. They can add a new beer to their list
and save it. They can even edit the beer information and delete that beer from the list. 
There is a limited selection of beers in the database, so the user should choose popular
beers.
